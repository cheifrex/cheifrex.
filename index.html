    I think my family tree is unique. I have uncles and aunts (from my father side) with a different religious beliefs and cultures which hinduism. Therefore, we always had a great time gathering together especially when it comes to a festival and celebration days like on Holi, New Year, Diwali and wedding ceremonies as well. In fact, this is a common situation in my country especially in my home town.
       
    I also love to watch film, listen to music, Dance or visiting to my Grandparents's house in my spare time. Other than that, I love to travel as well. I always spend my holidays to go to new places whether it's in our country or to go abroad.
    
    I'm pursuing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Nitte University. However, sometimes I've had a hard time since there are a lot of challenges as well. But even so, I've tried to look in a positive side, because I know dealing with problem's isn't an easy thing. In order to improve my work performance and myself, I believe there are still many things I have to learn, and need to strive for having a better life in the future.
